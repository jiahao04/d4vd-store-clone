# d4vd Store Clone

![Bootstrap](https://img.shields.io/badge/Styled%20With-Bootstrap-blue) ![HTML](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20With-HTML-orange)

This is a **replication** of the [d4vd Official Store](https://shop.d4vd.io/) using only **HTML and Bootstrap**. The project aims to mimic the structure and styling of the store while following these constraints:

- **No additional CSS** was usedâ€”only Bootstrap utilities.
- **Not a full clone**â€”only key pages were replicated (e.g., one product page template for all items).
- **Bootstrap colors** were used instead of exact color matches.
- **Default HTML font** was used (no custom fonts).
